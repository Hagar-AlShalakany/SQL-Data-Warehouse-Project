# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project
Building a data warehouse including ETL Process , data modelling and data analysis.

Welcome to the Data Warehouse Project, this represents my first full datawarehouse project , from engineering part ( creating the data warehouse and full data pipeline ) to the data analysis and business intelligence part (by exporing the data ana getting insights out of it ).


The data used here comes from two data sources: **ERP System** and **CRM** System.

Project Stages:
1. Creating the database
2. Connecting the dataset.
3. Handling data issues by applying data cleansing and preparation techniques.
4. Adding the business logic to the data to make it ready for the analysis.
5. Documenting the updates here in the Git Repository.



   About me, I'm Hagar Al Shalakany a data analyst and Bi developer.
